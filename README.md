# Tucked types (for Flow)

A new UX for tucking away static types.

```js
const findUsers = (users: Array<User>, predicate: User => Boolean): Array<User> => {
  const matches: Array<User> = [];
  for (let user of users) {
    if (predicate(user)) {
      matches.push(user);
    }
  }
  return matches;
};
```

```js
const findUsers = (users, predicate) => {
  const matches = [];
  for (let user of users) {
    if (predicate(user)) {
      matches.push(user);
    }
  }
  return matches;
};
```

_examples in Flow, but are directly translatable to languages with ML-style
annotations: TypeScript, Scala, F#, Kotlin, Swift, Hack, Reason, Pascal_

## Rationale

Names help us understand values at a glance, and types help us specify them more
clearly.

As a reader trying to skim code, types can be distractingâ€”like answers to
questions that we are not currently asking.

When code is more likely to be skimmed than studied, it is perhaps a better
default experience for an editor to hide types until called upon (e.g. via
mouseover).

With this, code can be presented in the style of a dynamic language,
while still adhering to the static types in the code underneath.

The _presence_ of type annotations are often optional to allow for inference.
Similarly, the _visibility_ of type annotations should optional as well, if you
believe these concepts to be useful when treated orthogonally.

## Implementation Plan

Look at how flow-remove-types works to extract types.

Name annotation

```
  name: type  ---->  name (underlined, popover "type")
```

Function return annotation

```
  function name(): type   ----> name (underlined, popover "=> type")
```

Expression annotation

```
  (...): type  ---->  ... (underline, popover "type")
```

Any generic parameters (inside angle brackets)

```
  class|function name<T, ...>   ---->  name (underlined, popover "<T, ...>")
                                       also, any child annotation should be prepended "<T, ...>"
```

Allowing write-mode requires consideration of how to allow annotations to be
added/modified/removed, how copy-pasting will function.

Atom - look at either DisplayMarkers or code-folding

Prettier - consider effect since line width is affected
